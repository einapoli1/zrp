## Dashboard

The landing page. Shows eight KPI cards:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| Open ECOs | ECOs not yet implemented or rejected |
| Low Stock | Items at or below reorder point |
| Open POs | Purchase orders not received or cancelled |
| Active WOs | Work orders that are open or in progress |
| Open NCRs | Quality issues not yet resolved |
| Open RMAs | Customer returns still being processed |
| Total Parts | Count of all parts in the gitplm database |
| Total Devices | Count of registered field devices |

Click any card to jump to that module.

### Charts

The dashboard includes visual charts:
- **ECOs by status** — bar/pie chart of draft, review, approved, implemented
- **Work orders by status** — open, in progress, completed
- **Top inventory by value** — highest-value items in stock

### Low Stock Alerts

A dedicated panel showing items where quantity on hand has fallen below the reorder point.

---

## Notifications

The bell icon in the top bar shows unread notifications. ZRP automatically generates notifications for:

| Type | Trigger | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Low Stock | Qty on hand < reorder point | Warning |
| Overdue WO | In progress > 7 days | Warning |
| Open NCR | Open > 14 days | Error |
| New RMA | Created in last hour | Info |

Notifications are deduplicated (same type + record only once per 24 hours). Click a notification to navigate to the relevant record. Click the checkmark to mark as read.

---

## Global Search

The search bar at the top of every page searches across **all modules** simultaneously:

- **Parts** — IPN, manufacturer, MPN, all field values
- **ECOs** — ID, title, description
- **Work Orders** — ID, assembly IPN
- **Devices** — serial number, IPN, customer
- **NCRs** — ID, title
- **Purchase Orders** — ID
- **Quotes** — ID, customer

Type at least one character and results appear grouped by module. Click any result to navigate to it.

---

## Parts (PLM)

**What it's for:** Browsing and searching your parts database. Parts are managed externally in gitplm CSV files — ZRP reads them and provides a searchable web interface.

**Key concepts:**
- **IPN** (Internal Part Number) — your unique identifier for each part
- **Category** — groups parts by type (capacitors, resistors, connectors, etc.)
- **Fields** — each category has its own columns from the CSV headers

**Common workflows:**

1. **Find a part:** Type in the search box or filter by category. Search matches against IPN and all field values.
2. **View details:** Click a part row to see all its fields.
3. **View BOM:** For assemblies, view the Bill of Materials showing sub-components.
4. **Edit BOM:** Click "Edit BOM" to modify the bill of materials for PCA- or ASY- assemblies.
5. **View cost:** See BOM cost rollup for assemblies.

### BOM Editing

For assembly parts (IPN starting with `PCA-` or `ASY-`), you can create and edit the BOM:

1. **Click "Edit BOM"** on the part detail page
2. **Add rows** for each component
3. **Search for parts** by typing in the IPN field — matching parts will appear in a dropdown
4. **Auto-fill description** — when you select a part from the dropdown, its description is automatically filled in
5. **Enter quantity** and reference designators (e.g., "R1, R2, R3")
6. **Save** — validates that all IPNs exist in the parts database

**Validation Rules:**
- All IPNs must exist in the parts database before saving
- Only assembly parts (PCA-, ASY- prefix) can have BOMs
- Empty rows are automatically filtered out when saving
- If validation fails, you'll see a clear error message: "Part {IPN} not found"

**IPN Autocomplete:** When entering an IPN in other modules (inventory, work orders, etc.), the system suggests matching IPNs as you type.

**Integration:** Parts IPNs are referenced by Inventory, Work Orders, Purchase Orders, Documents, NCRs, Quotes, and ECOs.

---

## ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)

**What it's for:** Tracking proposed changes to parts, assemblies, or processes before they're implemented.

**Status workflow:** `draft` → `review` → `approved` → `implemented`

**Common workflows:**

1. **Propose a change:** Create a new ECO with a title, description, priority, and list of affected IPNs.
2. **Submit for review:** Update the status to `review`.
3. **Approve:** Click the approve action. Records who approved and when.
4. **Implement:** After changes are made, mark as implemented.

**ECO→Parts enrichment:** When viewing an ECO, affected IPNs are enriched with part details (description, manufacturer, MPN) from the parts database.

**NCR→ECO auto-link:** ECOs can reference an NCR ID. When creating an ECO from an NCR, the link is maintained for traceability.

**Batch operations:** Select multiple ECOs with checkboxes, then bulk approve, implement, reject, or delete.

---

## Documents

**What it's for:** Managing revision-controlled engineering documents — assembly procedures, test specs, drawings, process instructions.

**Common workflows:**

1. **Create a document:** Give it a title, category, optional IPN link, and write the content.
2. **Edit and revise:** Update content and bump the revision letter.
3. **Approve:** Move from draft to approved when reviewed.
4. **Attach files:** Upload supporting files (PDFs, images) via the attachments panel.

---

## Inventory

**What it's for:** Tracking how much stock you have of each part, where it's stored, and when to reorder.

**Key concepts:**
- **Qty On Hand** — physical count in stock
- **Qty Reserved** — allocated to work orders
- **Reorder Point** — when on-hand drops to this level, a notification is generated
- **Transaction History** — every receive, issue, return, and adjustment is logged

**IPN Autocomplete:** When entering an IPN for a transaction, matching IPNs from the parts database are suggested.

**Integration:** Automatically updated when POs are received. Referenced by Work Order BOM checks. Low stock triggers dashboard alerts and notifications.

---

## Purchase Orders

**What it's for:** Ordering parts from vendors and tracking deliveries.

**Status workflow:** `draft` → `sent` → `partial` → `received`

**Common workflows:**

1. **Create a PO:** Select a vendor, add line items with part numbers and quantities.
2. **Generate from WO:** Automatically create a PO for work order shortages (see Procurement below).
3. **Send to vendor:** Update status to `sent`.
4. **Receive shipment:** Use the receive action with quantities for each line. Inventory updates automatically.

### Generate PO from Work Order Shortages

When a work order has BOM shortages, you can automatically generate a draft PO:

1. Open the work order and view the BOM
2. Click "Generate PO from Shortages"
3. Select a vendor
4. A draft PO is created with line items for all short components

---

## Vendors

**What it's for:** Keeping a directory of your suppliers with contact information and lead times.

---

## Work Orders

**What it's for:** Tracking production runs — building assemblies from components.

**Status workflow:** `open` → `in_progress` → `completed`

**Common workflows:**

1. **Plan production:** Create a WO specifying the assembly and quantity.
2. **Check materials:** Use the BOM view to verify all components are in stock.
3. **Start production:** Update status to `in_progress` (auto-records start time).
4. **Complete:** Update status to `completed` (auto-records completion time).

### BOM Shortage Highlighting

The BOM view color-codes each component:
- **Green (ok):** Sufficient stock
- **Yellow (low):** Some stock but not enough for the full build
- **Red (shortage):** Zero stock

### PDF Traveler

Click "Print Traveler" to generate a printable Work Order Traveler with:
- Assembly information and notes
- Full BOM table (IPN, description, MPN, manufacturer, qty, ref des)
- Sign-off section (kitted by, built by, tested by, QA approved by)

The traveler opens in a new tab with the print dialog ready.

**Batch operations:** Select multiple WOs to bulk complete, cancel, or delete.

---

## Test Records

**What it's for:** Recording factory test results for individual units identified by serial number.

---

## NCRs (Non-Conformance Reports)

**What it's for:** Documenting and tracking quality issues.

**NCR→ECO auto-link:** When an NCR identifies a design issue, create an ECO directly from the NCR. The ECO's `ncr_id` field maintains the link.

**Batch operations:** Select multiple NCRs to bulk close, resolve, or delete.

---

## Device Registry

**What it's for:** Tracking deployed devices in the field.

**Common workflows:**

1. **Register a device:** After production and testing, register the serial number.
2. **Import devices:** Upload a CSV file to bulk-register devices.
3. **Export devices:** Download all devices as a CSV.
4. **View history:** See full lifecycle — factory tests, firmware updates, campaigns.

**Batch operations:** Select multiple devices to bulk decommission or delete.

---

## Firmware Campaigns

**What it's for:** Managing OTA firmware rollouts to deployed devices.

### Live Streaming

---

## Quote Margin Analysis

In the Quote detail modal, click the **📊 Margin Analysis** tab to see:

- **BOM cost per line item** — sourced from the latest PO unit price for each IPN
- **Margin per unit** — quoted price minus BOM cost
- **Margin %** — color-coded: green (>50%), yellow (20–50%), red (<20%)
- **Summary totals** — total quoted, total BOM cost, total margin $, total margin %
- If no PO history exists for an IPN, the cost shows "—" with "No cost data"

---

## Supplier Price Catalog

Track price history for every part across vendors. Prices are recorded automatically when PO lines are received, and can also be added manually.

### Pricing Tab in Part Detail

When viewing any part, click the **💲 Pricing** tab to see:

- **Price history table** — vendor, unit price, min qty, lead time, date
- **Sparkline chart** — inline SVG showing price trend over time (hover points for details)
- **Best price highlight** — the lowest current unit price is marked with a green "Best" badge
- **Add Price button** — manually add a price entry with vendor dropdown, price, min qty, and lead time

### Automatic Price Recording

When receiving items on a Purchase Order (POST /api/v1/pos/:id/receive), the unit price from each PO line is automatically recorded in the price history, linked to the PO and vendor.

---

## Email Notifications

Configure SMTP to receive email notifications for system alerts (low stock, overdue work orders, aging NCRs, new RMAs).

### Email Settings (Admin → 📧 Email Settings)

- **SMTP host, port, username, password** — configure your mail server
- **From address and name** — the sender identity for outgoing emails
- **Enable/disable toggle** — turn email notifications on or off
- **Send Test Email** — verify configuration by sending a test message

### Email Log

The Email Settings page includes an **Email Log** table showing recent sent and failed emails with recipient, subject, status, error details, and timestamp.

### How It Works

When email is enabled, the background notification goroutine (runs every 5 minutes) will also send an email for each new notification. Each notification is only emailed once (tracked by an `emailed` flag). Emails are sent to the configured "from address" as the default recipient.

### Event-Driven Email Triggers

In addition to periodic notification emails, ZRP sends targeted emails on specific events:

- **ECO Approved** — When an ECO is approved, an email is sent to the ECO creator (falls back to admin address if no user email is set)
- **Low Stock Alert** — When an inventory transaction causes an item to drop below its reorder point, an email is sent to the admin
- **Overdue Work Order** — When a work order is updated and its due date has passed (and status is not closed/completed), an email is sent to the admin

All sent/failed emails are recorded in the email log for auditing.

## Product Configurator

**Purpose**: Generate all possible product variants with BOMs through the ECO process

**Key Features**:
- Template-based configuration with parameter placeholders
- Enum and range parameter types
- Conditional part inclusion via constraints
- Preview before generation
- ECO-based variant creation for approval workflow

**Workflow**:
1. Create configuration template with model format (e.g., `PCA-uATS-{voltage}-{amperage}`)
2. Define parameters:
   - **Enum**: Discrete values (e.g., `["120V", "208V", "240V"]`)
   - **Range**: Min/max values (e.g., `{"min": 10, "max": 100, "unit": "A"}`)
3. Build parts pool:
   - Mark common parts with "include_all_variants"
   - Set parameter constraints for conditional parts
4. Preview first 10 variants to verify configuration
5. Generate all variants → creates ECO with proposed parts
6. ECO approval creates all parts and BOMs

**Database Tables**:
- `configuration_templates`: Template definitions
- `configuration_parameters`: Parameter definitions (enum/range)
- `configuration_parts`: Parts pool with constraints
- `configuration_generations`: Generation history

**Constraints**:
- Model format must contain at least one `{param}` placeholder
- Parameter names: alphanumeric + underscore only
- Part IPNs must exist in parts table
- Constraint values must match parameter definitions

**Example**:
```
Template: "uATS 1.2kVA"
Model Format: "PCA-uATS-{voltage}-{amperage}"
Parameters:
  - voltage: enum ["120V", "208V"]
  - amperage: enum ["10A", "15A", "20A"]
Parts:
  - CAP-001 (qty: 2, all variants)
  - RES-120V (qty: 1, constraint: voltage=120V)
  - RES-208V (qty: 1, constraint: voltage=208V)

Generates 6 variants:
  - PCA-uATS-120V-10A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-120V x1)
  - PCA-uATS-120V-15A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-120V x1)
  - PCA-uATS-120V-20A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-120V x1)
  - PCA-uATS-208V-10A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-208V x1)
  - PCA-uATS-208V-15A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-208V x1)
  - PCA-uATS-208V-20A (BOM: CAP-001 x2, RES-208V x1)
```

**Integration**:
- Creates ECOs with status="pending" and type="configuration"
- ECO approval workflow remains unchanged
- Variants appear in parts table only after ECO approval
